		<h3 class="title">Very nearly-they are savages.</h3>
		<p>Arrived at the robing-room, I saw that neither of my companions nor any of the ship's crew were to follow us on this excursion. Captain Nemo had not even proposed my taking with me either Ned or Conseil. I am disturbing you, said I, for courtesy's sake. Where I do not know, when I cannot say; or, rather, I suppose it will end when these seas have nothing more to teach us. Very nearly-they are savages.</p>

		<p>And this captain is not going to cast anchor at all, since the tide will suffice? said Conseil simply. Captain Nemo stopped at these last words, regretting perhaps that he had spoken so much. But I had guessed that, whatever the motive which had forced him to seek independence under the sea, it had left him still a man, that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity, and that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as individuals. And I then understood for whom those millions were destined, which were forwarded by Captain Nemo when the Nautilus was cruising in the waters of Crete. How beautiful! How beautiful! cried Conseil. We were close to Vanikoro, really the one to which Dumont d'Urville gave the name of Isle de la Recherche, and exactly facing the little harbor of Vanou, situated in 16 4' south latitude, and 164 32' east longitude. The earth seemed covered with verdure from the shore to the summits in the interior, that were crowned by Mount Kapogo, 476 feet high. The Nautilus, having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait, found itself among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty fathoms deep. Under the verdant shade of some mangroves I perceived some savages, who appeared greatly surprised at our approach. In the long black body, moving between wind and water, did they not see some formidable cetacean that they regarded with suspicion?</p>

		<p>And in that case? Captain Nemo looked at me. I asked him no questions, but he guessed my thoughts, and answered of his own accord the questions which I was burning to address to him. Myself, answered Conseil; and waiting master's orders. We will think of them by and by.</p>
